## Our Project:
The Equitable AI for Dermatology competition challenged students to create a machine learning model that classifies 21 different skin conditions across diverse skin tones and addresses historical bias of those typically excluded from AI models. Break Through Tech AI Fellows from the Virtual, Boston (MIT), and Los Angeles (UCLA) programs competed to see whose model could most accurately assess skin conditions. Due to a lack of diverse training data in dermatology AI tools, people with darker skin tones are often diagnosed incorrectly which can lead to delayed treatments and health disparities for those groups. The competition seeks to address this issue by building an inclusive machine learning model for dermatology.
